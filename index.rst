Welcome to Swift for Linux!
===========================

*Swift for Linux* is a project aiming at making the experience of using the
`Swift programming language <https://swift.org/>`_ from Linux easier.

What's wrong?
*************

A lot! Apple only provides Swift binaries that run well on Ubuntu, and users of other
distros will have a fun time trying to get them to work. It's hard to share Swift
applications you've, and the majority of the ecosystem, being Mac-and-iOS-focused,
tends to create libraries that don't work under Linux. This guide is trying to be
a central point for people trying to get a great Swift experience on their Linux
systems.

If you have anything you'd like to add, or if you notice a problem in this guide, feel
free to `submit an issue <https://github.com/swift-linux/swift-linux>`_.
